## ðŸ§  **Project Overview: Compatibility-Based Item Recommendation System**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**
Build a recommendation system that suggests compatible items based on historical invoice data. The system uses **item-to-item collaborative filtering** enhanced with **domain-specific compatibility rules** to ensure recommendations are functionally valid (e.g., a specific door only pairs with its matching knob, hinge, etc.).

---

## ðŸ“¦ **Core Requirements**

### 1. **Input Data**
- **Invoices Dataset**: Contains transactions with fields like `customer_id`, `part_number`, and `date`.
- **Compatibility Mapping**: A dictionary that defines which items are compatible with each main item (e.g., `DO101` â†’ `KN101`, `HI101`, etc.).

### 2. **Processing Steps**

#### âœ… **Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Load and clean invoice data.
- Convert `date` to datetime format.
- Group transactions by `customer_id`.

#### âœ… **Step 2: Co-occurrence Matrix Construction**
- For each item purchased by a customer, find other items purchased within a Â±30-day window.
- Count co-occurrences **only if the items are compatible**, using:
  - A **forward compatibility dictionary** (e.g., `DO101` â†’ `KN101`)
  - A **reverse compatibility dictionary** (e.g., `KN101` â†’ `DO101`)
- Store counts in a symmetric co-occurrence matrix.

#### âœ… **Step 3: Recommendation Logic**
- When a user selects an item (e.g., `DO101`), recommend the top-N compatible items based on co-occurrence frequency.
- Optionally normalize scores using cosine similarity (Step 3 of the original plan).

---

## ðŸ§° **Technical Stack**
- **Python** with `pandas`, `collections`, and `datetime`
- No external databases or APIs required
- Console-based output or CSV export for the matrix

---

## ðŸ§© **Key Design Principles**
- **Compatibility-aware filtering**: Only recommend items that are explicitly compatible.
- **Symmetric co-occurrence**: Ensure that if `DO101` is bought with `KN101`, then `KN101` also suggests `DO101`.
- **Time-window filtering**: Only count co-purchases within a meaningful time frame (Â±30 days).

---

## ðŸ“ˆ **Future Extensions**
- Add a UI for selecting items and viewing recommendations.
- Integrate with a product catalog or e-commerce platform.
- Add category-level filtering (e.g., show only knobs when a door is selected).
